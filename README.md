### Some concepts
In python, regard 0, "", None as false, other numbers or strings as true

### Definition and Usage
The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.

None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.
